Consumer reviews of restaurants are scattered across various websites in the Internet. A typical user, on an average visits more than two websites to get the reviews of the restaurant to dine in. He also spends a considerable amount of time to get an overall idea of the quality of the restaurant by manually comparing the reviews in those websites. On the other hand, users who visit just one or two sites are not satisfied with the quality of the reviews and are often misled by the ratings.

In order to gain insights into the problem, we conducted an online survey with a set of relevant questions and collected the opinion of various users. In this paper, we discuss the data collection methods employed and how it helped us to identify the problems faced by the users. A sample solution could be an online tool that uses web scraping to aggregate the reviews from multiple websites and presents the information to the user by normalizing the ratings. Such a tool can save the time and  efforts taken by the users in getting the reviews and provide a hassle-free option to get the aggregated reviews from the most popular websites.
