   2. Code for three different solutions
      1. [Solution 1- Web Scraping application tool for aggregating the rating and reviews. ](https://github.com/moharnab123saikia/CSC510-group-f/tree/master/webscrapper)
      2. [Solution 2- Android based mobile app for aggregating restaurant reviews and ratings](https://github.com/moharnab123saikia/CSC510-group-f/tree/master/resto_scrapper_app/RestoScrapper)
      3. [Solution 3 - Chrome plugin to show aggregated ratings from the top websites](https://github.com/moharnab123saikia/CSC510-group-f/tree/master/resto-extension)
7. Evaluation Plan:
In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the three solutions, we will be performing user trial on each of them and will also gather large data logs (telemetry) to carryout analysis. We are using two tools namely Google Analytics and User Survey form to collect the telemetry reports. With the help of Google Analytics we are planning to track user interactions with the applications including the site usage, type of browser, user interests, site speed, bounce rate, etc. which will help us to understand the effectiveness of the tools we have developed. Each team member is planning to find 6-10 people to analyse the user experience of the different solutions we have implemented. Hence we will have 24-40 user tests with 8-14 tests per solution.

   In order to collect the user feedback directly we are planning to use a Google Survey Form with a set of questions including the preferred tool, the easiness of usage, etc. The same set of survey participants will be requested to provide feedback for the tool they have used. After collecting both the statistical reports we are planning to analyze the effectiveness of the features in achieving the desired goal. And also we have planned the following milestones for the next deliverable.
   1. Milestone 1: User trial and testing of web app tool for RestoScrapper
         1. Todo Issue 1: User trial for web scraping application tool and implement change based on user trial.
         2. Todo Issue 2: User trial for android based mobile application and implement change for better user experience
         3. Todo Issue 3: User trial and testing for chrome browser based plugin for rating and review aggregation.
   2. Milestone 2:  Collection of user logs for analysis
         1. Todo Issue 1: Gathering user logs from google analytics for web app tool as well as android app( sample log has been uploaded in telemetry section)
         2. Todo Issue 2: Collecting the feedback from the user survey (sample survey form has been uploaded in telemetry section)
   3. Milestone 3: Analysis of the user logs to evaluate each of the solution
         1. Todo Issue 1: Telemetry data analysis to decide the best of three implemented tools
         2. Todo Issue 2: Coming up with ideas for feature enhancement to improve user experience.
