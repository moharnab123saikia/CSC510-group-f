I wouldn't recommend these pizzas for sharing, unless you are ordering some other items, because of this reason (And also because it is just too good to share).

The fried chicken is so crispy and the seasoning in the coating is so good.

The waffle is light and fluffy, and does great to contrast the crispiness of the fried chicken. Just cover everything in that honey sauce and you'll be good to go.
