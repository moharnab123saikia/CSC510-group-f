If other restaurants are smart, they'll start having honey as a toppings option also. The contrast between the spicy sausage and the black pepper with the sweet honey worked amazingly. Another thing that I really like about Tazza's pizzas is that they have very thin crusts. It makes the pizza not too filling and I don't feel like I'm in a food coma when I finish, unlike my experiences at most pizza places. I wouldn't recommend these pizzas for sharing, unless you are ordering some other items, because of this reason (And also because it is just too good to share). But another thing with them having such a thin crust, is that the weight of the toppings and cheese overpower it a bit, so the crust went somewhat limp.

I thought since we had five I better call just in case. I called and asked if they had a 5:30 spot. I was told that we could be squeezed in and they would see use then. We got to the restaurant about 5:25. I went to the server and said my name and we had reservations. She said \"That's good because we only take reservations\". I told her they might want to clarify that on their website and immediately had attitude thrown at me. Just trying to help...anyway she found the reservation and said \"yes we have you here\" and that was it. No waiting a moment, no we can seat you now, just a blank stare. So I asked \"do we wait?\"  The hostess says \"it will be a while. We have to get a table for you.\" You take the reservation, but do you hold the reservation... we hang out in the foyer and about fifteen minutes later we are finally sat.", "scale": "1.0"}, {"review": "Made reservations for 8PM on a Saturday. Walked in and we were seated within 6-8 minutes. Apparently, there was a party on the patio thus causing all of the tables that balanced between the patio and inside, to all be shoved inside. We were seated by the bathrooms on the high-top tables and it was the most obnoxious spot. It was extremely high traffic with the bathrooms and kitchen in the same corner. This situation bothered us because this was our one date night to relax and enjoy each other's company but people kept bumping into our table and it was SO LOUD. We eventually moved more inside the table (it was a 4 seater) versus the two outside spots. Environment was bad. I started with a side Caesar salad. It was heavily covered in a flavorless Caesar dressing (I think they omitted the zing from the anchovies) with tons of shredded cheese and croutons (that were not bad). For appetizer we started with the NZ Lamb Lollipops. 0/5 stars. They were raw which we did not order, they weren't seasoned well, they were served mildly warm, and the meat wasn't even tender. We threw 2 of them away. The grits were whatever. Nothing to rave about and because they were only mildly warm they weren't even decent. After the table situation and lollipop crap, we decided to share a meal and thank goodness we did because again HORRIBLE! We shared the St. Louis Style Ribs. The seasoning was crap, the meat was not tender or juicy (pretty dry honestly), and again it was served mildly warm. We chose the Smoked Gouda Mashed potatoes. No these were not \"mashed\" they were pulverized to a sloppy mess to the consistency of pudding just sloppily displayed on the plate. The pictures showed them somewhat chunky. Not that I'm a huge fan of Chili's, but even a CHAIN restaurant has better mashed potatoes. The server was kind enough to sample out all 4 sauces with our meal. ALL 4 WERE HORRIBLE!!! I think the worst was the rootbeer. It was literally a sugary, tomato, BBQ sauce. I couldn't even cover up my nasty meat with a good sauce to hide the taste. Not ONE SINGLE PART OF OUR MEAL WAS EVEN DECENT. WE THREW AWAY MOST OF OUR FOOD. We did however order 2 martinis and the \"Paradise\" drink (not the exact name but I couldn't find online).

A little more time on the smoker was needed as the meat was slightly undercooked. I believe this is what led to the lack of flavor other than the sauce, my nephew, slathered on top of it.
